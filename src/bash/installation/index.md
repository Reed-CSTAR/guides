# Installation

You might already have Bash installed.

+ If your computer is running Linux, you most certainly have Bash on your
  computer already. See the [Linux](./linux.html) section for instructions on how
  to access it.

+ If you're running MacOS, you've already got zsh, which, for our purposes here,
  is basically the same thing. See [here](./macos.html) to learn how to access it.

+ If your computer runs Windows, you'll want to install the Windows Subsystem
  for Linux (WSL). See [here](./windows.html).

Once you've got it installed, you'll be able to open your terminal and do
something like this:

```bash
$ echo "Hello, world!"
Hello, world!
```
