# Accounts

At Reed's instruction, your username is fixed at account creation to be your
Kerberos username. Then, your password is set on Polly and copied out to
everywhere else. Don't try to change your password on other machines; always
SSH into Polly.[^web]

[^web]: At some point, I (Tali) might make a web app to change your password
    without SSH'ing. If this happens, I'll link it.

## Graduation

After you graduate, we'll delete your account, including any data that you
may have.

Spring class of 2025: We've already deleted your accounts, but your home
directories are still around. Send an email if you want me an archive of
them.

Fall class of 2025 and onwards: We'll send you your home directories as a
tarball via email. Then, we'll delete everything. If you've got any
additional last wishes, just send an email.
