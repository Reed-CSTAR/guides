## Authentication Mechanisms

We are not able to tie into Kerberos for a 'proper' SSO. Instead, we run a
combination of two mechanisms, both on Polly, to make sure that everything
stays in sync and that users don't need to change their password on 7+
machines.

### Authelia

[Authelia](https://authelia.com/) is our OIDC provider. With minimal extra
configuration, it can also run as part of a reverse proxy to provide
authentication to web services which don't have OAuth/OIDC support. Authelia
has a few other mechanisms available for serving auth, and should be able to
integrate with most services.

It runs on Polly and keeps a list of users from a `users.yml` file which is
autogenerated from `/etc/shadow/`.

> [!WARNING]
> Authelia runs as a service called `authelia-custom`. Do *not* use
> `authelia.service`.

### `shadow-syncd`

`shadow-syncd` is the name of a small Python script that runs on Polly and
propagates all changes in `/etc/shadow` to the other machines. This keeps SSH
and physical logins consistent without the complication of PAM for LDAP, OIDC,
or anything of the sort.

## Adding a New Machine

If the machine is owned by Reed (it should have an asset number and barcode;
ask CUS in unclear cases), it needs to have an admin (sudo-capabale) account
named for cus and for reedadmin. Additionally, it'll need to have Crowdstrike
installed, so it should be running Ubuntu.

To set it up, make sure the MAC address isn't being blocked (i.e., that it has
internet access over Ethernet). If there are problems here, the issue should be
brought to CUS. Install Ubuntu and set up the `polytopia` admin account. Email
CUS to ask them to set up their admin accounts and Crowdstrike. Then, add it to
the `inventory.yaml` file and run any applicable Ansible playbooks.

If, on the other hand, the machine is *not* Reed-owned (e.g., Quail), CUS asks
us to have it set up individually on Netreg. That is, you're meant to set it up
in netreg as your own individual device. Then, you should install either NixOS
or Ubuntu,[^os-choice] set up the `polytopia` admin account, and get it set up with Ansible
as per usual.

[^os-choice]: The account mechanisms as of now rely on a writable `/etc`. In
    particular, since Polly tries to copy its shadow into other machines, a
    NixOS machine meant to be accessed by all CSTAR-registered users will
    require some special treatment. My (Tali's) suggestion is to reserve
    personal machines for servers that don't require SSH access by individuals,
    where we can get away just with a Polytopia admin account.
