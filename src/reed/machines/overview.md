# Machines

Reed provides some machines for you to use. Some of these can be accessed in
person, but others are best accessed over [ssh](../../shell/ssh.md).

> [!NOTE]
> To get access to all of these machines, email
> [CSTAR](mailto:cstar@groups.reed.edu).

These machines all run Ubuntu with Nix installed for user package management.

## Peggy, Patty, and Polly

Peggy is in the corner of [Polytopia](polytopia.md) and runs Ubuntu. You can
also access it from the Reed college Wi-fi over ssh at `peggy.reed.edu`.

Polly and Patty are in Jim's office, and can be accessed solely by ssh over
the Reed college Wi-fi at `polly.reed.edu` and `patty.reed.edu`,
respectively. Patty in particular is useful when you're in need of some extra
compute power.

## The Dumplings

Banku, Empanada, Gyoza, and Pierogi are iMacs running Ubuntu available for
use in Polytopia. These are available at `banku.reed.edu`,
`empanada.reed.edu`, `gyoza.reed.edu`, and `pierogi.reed.edu` over the Reed
Wi-fi.
