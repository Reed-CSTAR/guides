# Reed CS Resources

You have access to many tools, like [your own Reed website](./website.md),
[compute resources](./machines.html), and access to Polytopia (located in
[LIB387](https://library.reed.edu/about/maps.html#tab1-5)). If you have any
questions about any of these resources, feel free to email CSTAR: it's harder
to look up any Reed resources than anything else in this guide.
