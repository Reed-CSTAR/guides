# Machines

Reed provides some machines for you to use. Some of these can be accessed in
person, but others are best accessed over [ssh](/shell/ssh.md).

> To get access to all of these machines, email
> [CSTAR](mailto:cstar@groups.reed.edu).

These machines all run Ubuntu with Nix installed for user package management.

Peggy is in the corner of [Polytopia](polytopia.md) and runs Ubuntu. You can
also access it from the Reed Wi-fi over ssh at `peggy.reed.edu`.

Polly and Patty are in Jim's office, and can be accessed solely over ssh
from the Reed Wi-Fi at `polly.reed.edu` and `patty.reed.edu`, respectively.

power.
