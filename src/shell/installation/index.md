# Installation

You might already have a shell installed.

+ If your computer is running Linux, you almost certainly have a shell called Bash installed on your
  computer already. See the [Linux](./linux.html) section for instructions on how
  to access it.

+ If you're running MacOS, you've already got a shell called `zsh`. See
  [here](./macos.html) to learn how to access it.

+ If your computer runs Windows, you'll want to install the Windows Subsystem
  for Linux (WSL). See [here](./windows.html).

Once you've got a shell installed, you'll be able to open your terminal and do
something like this:

```shell
$ echo "Hello, world!"
Hello, world!
```
