# Writing Code

This section covers some more mechanical issues with writing code. How is code
stored? How is it executed? How do you edit it? These questions are the
frustrating, tooling-immersed bretheren of the more interesting questions
you'll study in your classes, but, nevertheless, they demand answering.
If you've written a good amount of code before, nothing here should be
surprising. If you haven't, this can serve as a reference and also a brief
explanation on how to really do that thing we call computer programming.
