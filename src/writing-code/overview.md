# Writing Code

This section covers some more mechanical issues with writing code. How is code
stored? How is it executed? How do you edit it? These questions are the
frustrating, tooling-immersed bretheren of the more interesting questions
you'll study in your classes, but, nevertheless, they demand answering.
If you've written a good amount of code before, nothing here should be
surprising. If you haven't, this can serve as a reference and also a brief
explanation on the more mundane steps involved in that thing we call computer
programming.

Certain concepts are universal to most programming languages --- these concepts
are specified further in this chapter --- but certain languages demand specific
**toolchains** to run code written in those languages. The language you're
using largely depends on the class you're taking. Feel free to follow the links
as appropriate or simply explore:

+ 121 is taught with [Python](./python/overview.html).
+ 221 is taught with [C, C++, and Assembly](c-and-asm/overview.html).
+ You will encounter other toolchains; e.g., Jupyter notebooks for Deep
  Learning, JS (or possibly TypeScript soon!) for graphics, and OCaml for
  Programming Languages. If you have toolchain quesstions, [let us
  know.](https://github.com/Reed-CSTAR/guides/issues)
